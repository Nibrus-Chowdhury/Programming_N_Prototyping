# Space Station Unity

**Story Synopsis:** You are an astronaut stuck in a spaceship with three other crew members. Your ship core has malfunctioned and needs repair but to repair it you need four gems. These gems can be found in outer space along with other vital supplies like food and water. Food and water is limited so you need to split it between all crew members. If crew members do not get a share of food and water for a long time then they will not be satisfied and there will be chaos, making it impossible to fix your core. Be wary though, asteroids are in space and you don't want to get hit by them.
